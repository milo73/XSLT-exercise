             The RequestForUpdate route is responsible for updating a document in the
                FuseStore and providing deltas in the form of a NOU messages to a JMS queue (to be
                distributed to separate systems). 
             This artifact is prepared to handle multiple document types and multiple
                versions of each document. Each document is stored in it's own collection, by
                default the collection name used is the same as the document type. When multiple
                versions of a document type are configured in the allowedDocuments.xml configuration
                file, the document that is persisted in the fuse store is always first upgraded to
                the highest version for that document type. This upgrade is done by means of the
                configured XSLT in the same configuration file. This is also the case when a new
                document is created by a lower versioned RFU. An RFU can contain a complete document
                or a fragment of this. When a fragment is given the update is done on this level
                only, leaving the remaining fragments in tact. 
             The delta detection of the incoming document and the persisted document is
                done, after both have been upgraded to the highest version. When a delta is found
                and the supplied document adheres to the business rules for that document including
                a correct document version number ( document sequence number) amongst others, the
                document is persisted. In the resulting RFUR the complete document as stored in the
                fuse store is embedded. 
             The generated NOU messages are based only on the delta's and will only
                contain the updated fragments of a document. When multiple NOU versions are
                configured to be send, a NOU message is send for each configured version, the
                transformation of these messages is done using the same XSLT as configured for the
                document types. 
             The delivery of Nou messages is performed in a different Camel context, and
                in case it is not successful, it attempts the delivery to the failover queue
                provided in the designated configuration parameter and then it suspends the RFU
                route context. If even the delivery to the failover queue fails, the nou message is
                saved in the filesystem for future processing. 
             When multiple RFU versions of a specific document type are allowed, it can
                lead to potential data-loss when two systems have control over the same fragment. A
                fragment that has an extra element in a higher version, might lose this information
                when a lower versioned RFU is executed on this fragment. It can even happen that a
                different fragment that is considered mandatory in the highest version is changed to
                its default state, when a lower versioned RFU on a different fragment is performed.
                This is per design and is currently not a problem, since only one version of the RFU
                is allowed. 
             In the newly introduced allowedMessages.xml and allowedDocuments.xml files
                it is possible to configured the allowed messages coming in, i.e. the
                requestForInformation and the related version, and the allowed documents to be
                persisted, ie. the document types like outlet.

             The RequestForUpdate route is responsible for updating a document in the
                FuseStore and providing deltas in the form of a NOU messages to a JMS queue (to be
                distributed to separate systems). 
             This artifact is prepared to handle multiple document types and multiple
                versions of each document. Each document is stored in it's own collection, by
                default the collection name used is the same as the document type. When multiple
                versions of a document type are configured in the allowedDocuments.xml configuration
                file, the document that is persisted in the fuse store is always first upgraded to
                the highest version for that document type. This upgrade is done by means of the
                configured XSLT in the same configuration file. This is also the case when a new
                document is created by a lower versioned RFU. An RFU can contain a complete document
                or a fragment of this. When a fragment is given the update is done on this level
                only, leaving the remaining fragments in tact. 
             The delta detection of the incoming document and the persisted document is
                done, after both have been upgraded to the highest version. When a delta is found
                and the supplied document adheres to the business rules for that document including
                a correct document version number ( document sequence number) amongst others, the
                document is persisted. In the resulting RFUR the complete document as stored in the
                fuse store is embedded. 
             The generated NOU messages are based only on the delta's and will only
                contain the updated fragments of a document. When multiple NOU versions are
                configured to be send, a NOU message is send for each configured version, the
                transformation of these messages is done using the same XSLT as configured for the
                document types. 
             The delivery of Nou messages is performed in a different Camel context, and
                in case it is not successful, it attempts the delivery to the failover queue
                provided in the designated configuration parameter and then it suspends the RFU
                route context. If even the delivery to the failover queue fails, the nou message is
                saved in the filesystem for future processing. 
             When multiple RFU versions of a specific document type are allowed, it can
                lead to potential data-loss when two systems have control over the same fragment. A
                fragment that has an extra element in a higher version, might lose this information
                when a lower versioned RFU is executed on this fragment. It can even happen that a
                different fragment that is considered mandatory in the highest version is changed to
                its default state, when a lower versioned RFU on a different fragment is performed.
                This is per design and is currently not a problem, since only one version of the RFU
                is allowed. 
             In the newly introduced allowedMessages.xml and allowedDocuments.xml files
                it is possible to configured the allowed messages coming in, i.e. the
                requestForInformation and the related version, and the allowed documents to be
                persisted, ie. the document types like outlet.

             The validation-hi route validates name and address fragments by calling the
                Human Inference (HI) service. The result of this call is incorporated into the
                original fragment. 
             In general the response of HI will become the leading answer. However when a
                conflict was found between some of the fields of the fragment, An alternative
                fragment is included into the original fragment. Any fields that were originally
                left blank and were complemented by HI are also enriched in this alternative
                fragment. This will give the end-user the ability to overrule the validation of HI.
                When no conflict is found the alternative fragment will not be generated. For
                name/business validations the alternative section will not be enriched with data
                from HI, instead the original fragment will be constructed so that all information
                is consisted with the validated business name. 
             When an alternative fragment is included it will have it's own quality
                element - with a unique datahash, including a message stating that the end-user has
                overruled HI. 
             When HI is for some reason unavailable, the validation result will state
                this in the user message. This will allow the business to continue.

            The esb-validation-facade (EVF) is an internal MCD component. The EVF is
                built as a collection of Apache Camel routes, where each route implements a specific
                validation. There are routes for the validation of telephone numbers, IBAN formatted
                bank account numbers, email addresses, (web) uniform resource locators, and names
                and addresses.
            A 'main' route is responsible for accepting 'request for validation' (RFV)
                messages, and producing request for validation response (RFVR) messages. An RFV
                message contains an 'std' element that contains the fragment to validate. The
                fragment in the RFV message is passed verbatim to the appropriate validation route.
                The validation response coming back from the sub routes is wrapped by the main route
                in an RFVR.
            For its correct operation the EVF relies on the esb-ws-endpoint (which is the
                principle entry point of the ESB) to tell which validation to perform on the
                incoming RFV message. Also the esb-ws-endpoint ensures that the RFV message
                validates against the RFV schema.
